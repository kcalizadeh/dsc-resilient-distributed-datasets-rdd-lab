An RDD is essentially the Spark representation of a set of data, spread across multiple machines, with APIs to let you act on it.

This means that even if one of the nodes goes offline, RDDs will be able to restore the data. This is already a huge advantage compared to standard storage. If a standard computer dies while performing an operation, all of its memory will be lost in the process. With RDDs, multiple nodes can go offline, and the action will still be held in working memory.\n","\n","Distributed: The data is contained on multiple nodes of a cluster-computing operation. It is efficiently partitioned to allow for parallelism.\n","\n","Dataset: The dataset has been * partitioned * across the multiple nodes. \n","\n","RDDs are the building block upon which more high-level Spark operations are based upon. Chances are, if you are performing an action using Spark, the operation involves RDDs. \n","\n","\n","\n","Key Characteristics of RDDs:\n","\n","- Immutable: Once an RDD is created, it cannot be modified. \n","- Lazily Evaluated: RDDs will not be evaluated until an action is triggered. Essentially, when RDDs are created, they are programmed to perform some action, but that function will not get activated until it is explicitly called. The reason for lazy evaluation is that allows users to organize the actions of their Spark program into smaller actions. It also saves unnecessary computation and memory load.\n","- In-Memory: The operations in Spark are performed in-memory rather than in the database. This is what allows Spark to perform fast operations with very large quantities of data.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### RDD Transformations vs Actions\n","\n","In Spark, we first create a __base RDD__ and then apply one or more transformations to that base RDD following our processing needs. Being immutable means, **once an RDD is created, it cannot be changed**. As a result, **each transformation of an RDD creates a new RDD**. Finally, we can apply one or more **actions** to the RDDs. Spark uses lazy evaluation, so transformations are not actually executed until an action occurs.\n","\n","\n","<img src=\"./images/rdd_diagram.png\" width=500>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Transformations\n","\n","Transformations create a new dataset from an existing one by passing each dataset element through a function and returning a new RDD representing the results. In short, creating an RDD from an existing RDD is ‘transformation’.\n","All transformations in Spark are lazy. They do not compute their results right away. Instead, they just remember the transformations applied to some base dataset (e.g. a file). The transformations are only computed when an action requires a result that needs to be returned to the driver program.\n","A transformation is an RDD that returns another RDD, like map, flatMap, filter, reduceByKey, join, cogroup, etc.\n","\n","### Actions\n","Actions return final results of RDD computations. Actions trigger execution using lineage graph to load the data into original RDD and carry out all intermediate transformations and return the final results to the driver program or writes it out to the file system. An action returns a value (to a Spark driver - the user program).\n","\n","Here are some key transformations and actions that we will explore.\n","\n","\n","| Transformations   | Actions       |\n","|-------------------|---------------|\n","| map(func)         | reduce(func)  |\n","| filter(func)      | collect()     |\n","| groupByKey()      | count()       |\n","| reduceByKey(func) | first()       |\n","| mapValues(func)   | take()        |\n","| sample()          | countByKey()  |\n","| distinct()        | foreach(func) |\n","| sortByKey()       |               |\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Let's see how transformations and actions work through a simple example.
